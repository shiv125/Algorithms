There are three files which I have attached:
shiv_stack.h
shiv_stack.c
test1.x

In files shiv_stack.h and shiv_stack.c, I have implemented stacks with data types int and char..
In file test1.c, with the help of these two files I have made an program which will calculate the string with operators, [-,+,*,/,^] .
To compile and run the program 
all the files should be in the same folder.
use this command:
gcc test1.c shiv_stack.c -lm
